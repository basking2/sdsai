for holes, compute if a ring is clock-wise or counter-clockwise.

> Sum over the edges, (x2 âˆ’ x1)(y2 + y1). If the result is positive the curve is clockwise, if it's negative the curve is counter-clockwise. (The result is twice the enclosed area, with a +/- convention.)


Holes are clockwise.
FROM https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#page-9
   o  A linear ring MUST follow the right-hand rule with respect to the
      area it bounds, i.e., exterior rings are counterclockwise, and
      holes are clockwise.
