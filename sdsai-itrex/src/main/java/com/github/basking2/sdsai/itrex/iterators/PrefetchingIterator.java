/**
 * An iterator that prefetches and caches some number of elements from another iterator.
 *
 * Sometimes it is expensive for an iterator to return a value.
 * In these situations it is sometimes preferable to pre-fetch a few objects, and
 * asynchronously replenish them.
 *
 * Order is preserved, so if there is a particularly slow fetch, it may stall future fetches.
 * 
 * This is just a kind of {@link ParallelIteratorIterator} that uses a single iterator.
